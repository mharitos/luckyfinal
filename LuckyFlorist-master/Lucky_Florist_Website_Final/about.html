            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="about_text">
                For three generations the Davis family has proudly been serving the greater East Bay area. Since 1935, the store has been on the corner of Telegraph and West MacArthur. It all began when Eleanor and Max Davis immigrated to America. Together they started selling flowers and worked with many relatives to build the business. Eleanor felt so lucky to able start a business that she named the store Lucky Florist. In 1961, their son Robert joined the business and ran it with his father until Max fell ill. <br><br>Today, Eleanor and Max’s grandson Jay designs and operates the business. Jay started working in the store when he was 15. He loved helping customers and learning about floral designing. In 1987 when he went into the store to help for Mother’s Day he knew where he needed to be full time, so he joined the family business. Jay has built strong relationships with the community over the years from places of worship,  to small businesses and large companies, funeral homes and hospitals, schools and the cities of Oakland, Berkeley and Emeryville. <br><br>Customers appreciate the personalized service, and attention to detail. It’s not usual to hear a customer reminisce when they came to us when they got married or went to prom decades ago! <br><br> Along with the highest quality flowers, we also carry plants, balloons, plush animals and greeting cards to add to your floral arrangements. Give us call, come on in or have us deliver your flowers for locally or we can help you send flowers anywhere in the US. We’ve been taking care of our customers for 85 years, you can depend for us for complete customer satisfaction.
