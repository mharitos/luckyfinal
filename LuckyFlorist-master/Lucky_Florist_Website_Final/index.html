                <i>"Used Lucky Florist for our wedding and everything was better than I could have asked for. If I could rate them higher I would. The communication was amazing, as was the customer service and of course the flowers. Jay hand picked the most gorgeous flowers I have ever seen. It's so wonderful to work with people who love their jobs and what they do. It is also a local business and those need as much support as we can give them. Please please go to Lucky's for all of your flower needs!"</i><br><br> <b>-Anna, San Francisco</b><br> <a class="yelp" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-florists-oakland">Yelp</a>

                <i>"My family has been to Lucky Florist for generations. I went in to buy a plant for a very nice friend of mine and his wife. I first spoke with Jay over the phone and he is very nice. I went down 2 days later to pick out the plant that would suit the occasion and I felt right at home. Thank you Jay for delivering my plant and for the overall time spent and help. I will always come here for plant/flower purchases."</i><br><br> <b>-Alahn, San Leandro</b><br> <a class="yelp" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-florists-oakland">Yelp</a>
